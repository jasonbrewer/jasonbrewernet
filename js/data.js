The piece plays across four screens built from eight 75-inch panels mounted vertically, shot entirely in 8K: high-resolution capture composed specifically for vertical presentation, and finished to run continuously — every day, in a world-class museum — rather than for a single campaign. Much of it was shot outdoors, on location across Colonial Williamsburg's public park grounds and historic green spaces — combining ground-based field capture with aerial drone cinematography over the grounds, working in natural light and real, changing conditions to capture the setting authentically, the way a visitor actually experiences it. Everything in 8K, professionally color-corrected and edited, composed for vertical display, and built as a permanent, evergreen asset the institution will run for years. Outdoor, aerial and ground, high-resolution, vertical-first, and made to last — the same standard a destination content library lives on. It's exactly what destination work depends on.

In a recent YouTube video, Chris Young of Combustion Inc. broke down the strengths and weaknesses of both, offering a rare side-by-side comparison that cuts through the hype. The Pacojet, long considered the gold standard in professional kitchens, has unmatched precision and produces luxuriously fine textures. But it comes with a serious price tag and is designed with restaurant-scale operations in mind. The Ninja Creami, on the other hand, is accessible to home cooks, relatively affordable, and surprisingly versatile. While it doesn't quite reach the same level of refinement as the Pacojet, it delivers impressive results for its price point — making frozen sorbets, gelato, and ice cream within minutes. The video highlights Chris Young's deep technical understanding of food science while giving viewers a practical, honest assessment: professionals may still lean on the Pacojet, but the Ninja Creami opens doors for experimentation in everyday kitchens. I had the privilege of producing, directing, and editing this video, ensuring the visuals matched the clarity and precision of Chris's insights. It's a piece designed to inform, inspire, and spark debate among chefs and passionate home cooks alike.",
